Introduction
NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. This tutorial will guide you through the fundamental concepts and operations in NumPy.

What is NumPy?
NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is the core library for scientific computing in Python. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays. It is the foundation upon which nearly all of the higher-level tools in the PyData ecosystem are built.

Key Features of NumPy
ndarray: A fast and space-efficient multidimensional array providing vectorized arithmetic operations and sophisticated broadcasting capabilities.
Mathematical Functions: A wide variety of mathematical operations, including basic arithmetic, linear algebra, statistical operations, and more.
Random Number Generation: Tools for generating random numbers.
Integration with C/C++ and Fortran Code: Ease of integration with low-level languages for high-performance computing.
